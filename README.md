# Weather-App

Challenge-6

***

The outcome of this project is to have a fully functional weather dashboard using the openweather api. The user story and acceptance criteria goes as follows, 
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

Acceptance criteria:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

In this application I created all the nessessray javascript to fetch each part of the acceptance criteria. However, I am having complications with my api key. Which is hendering the city information from being displayed.
